        <b>Who am I?</b><br /><br /><br />

        Although I have formally finished school, I still consider myself a
        student. I am constantly learning from everyone and everything, related
        to computer science and everything else. I truly believe that everyone
        has something to teach me, So if you feel you have something I can learn
        from you, I'd love to connect or hear from you.
        <br /><br />
        I program in Bash, Python, C, Javascript, HTML, CSS and SQL using them
        to ethically hack, experiment and develop software that matters.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <b>What I'm doing now.</b>
        <br /><br />
        Currently I am developing and maintaining an open source operating
        system based on the Linux kernel, It is held on GitHub for anyone to
        fork and contribute to.
        <br /><br />
        I'm also running my own home server, which I use to self-host files,
        containerised services (including game servers and web servers), and a
        local smart assistant system.
        <br /><br />
        In addition to this, I am building and maintaining my own home server to
        host files, hold containers for game servers, webservers and a local
        smart assistant.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <b>Where I'm going?</b>
        <br /><br />
        I'm seeking to strengthen my understanding in fundamental of computing,
        low-level software, system architecture and the software side of
        networking.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <b>TL;DR</b>
        <br /><br />
        I'm a terminal junkie obsessed with Linux and DIY software projects.
